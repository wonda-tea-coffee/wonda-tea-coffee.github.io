In this time, it was the first time in the program's history that it had the smallest number of performers.  
The performers were Yoda, Umezawa, and Yamashita, who won the previous cooking project.  
The three were served a home‚Äêcooked meal by Bananaman's as a prize.  
Himura served a casserole of wiener and Chinese cabbage, while Shitara served jingisukan and barbecued pork.  
After meal, they talked about their own memorable episodes, things they wanted to ask Bananaman, and advice on their problems to Bananaman.
